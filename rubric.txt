Your Task
Create a Django application with the following features.

Back end:

X One model to represent both boasts and roasts
X Boolean to tell whether it's a boast or a roast
X CharField to put the content of the post in
X IntegerField for up votes
X IntegerField for down votes
 XDateTimeField for submission time
Front end: 

X Homepage that displays boasts and roasts, sorted by time submitted (hint --> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#order-by (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.)
X Buttons to filter the content by either boasts or roasts, sorted by time submitted
X Upvote and downvote buttons for each boast and roast
when clicked, these buttons affect the numbers on the relevant post appropriately
Ability to sort content based on vote score (hint: you may need to calculate the vote score) 
Page to submit a boast or a roast
Hints:

button hrefs can use template data, just like everything else
voting is not meant to be secure; this is effectively a proof of concept application
you do not need to worry about figuring out if someone has already voted on something
